# WeatherBros.
A small web app to check out the weather in your current location & search for a location to. This was a development project to help me learn the ropes of React and also with some API usage too.

The "WeatherBros." are my twin boys, Zac and Eli - who love to update me with the weather every 5 seconds...


### Using
